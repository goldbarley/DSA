# Data Structures and Algorithms

## A repository which consists of different types of algorithms and a few data structures.

**I have tried my best to keep everything as organized as possible. So, if you see anything out of place, let me know, I wll fix it.**

### Some things to keep in mind:
1. All graph traversal algorithms all use the common `Graph.java` class to generate a random graph of a given size. 
2. All searching and sorting algorithms are `public`, i.e. it can be accessed from any directory, so you don't have to worry about access modifiers as much.

**In case you encounter any bugs or don't understand a part of any code, you can ask me personally, I'll try my best to explain it to you as effectively as possible.**

### I hope I was able to make the repository upto your expectations. If you feel like anything is missing, let me know personally and I will try my best to add it.
